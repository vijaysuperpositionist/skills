## 🛠️ Impeccable Workflow (17 skills)

A full production pipeline from [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable). Each skill is a **stage**. Designed to chain together as one workflow rather than be used in isolation.

### Plan → Build → Refine → Dial → Review → Ship

| Stage | Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Plan** | [`shape`](./skills/impeccable/shape) | Plan UX/UI before writing code — structured discovery interview + design brief |
| **Build** | [`impeccable`](./skills/impeccable/impeccable) | Generate distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces — avoids generic AI aesthetics |
| **Refine** | [`layout`](./skills/impeccable/layout) | Fix spacing, visual rhythm, weak hierarchy, monotonous grids, alignment problems |
| **Refine** | [`typeset`](./skills/impeccable/typeset) | Fix font choices, hierarchy, sizing, weight, readability |
| **Refine** | [`colorize`](./skills/impeccable/colorize) | Add strategic color to monochromatic designs |
| **Refine** | [`animate`](./skills/impeccable/animate) | Purposeful animations + micro-interactions + motion |
| **Refine** | [`adapt`](./skills/impeccable/adapt) | Responsive breakpoints, fluid layouts, touch targets across devices |
| **Refine** | [`optimize`](./skills/impeccable/optimize) | UI performance — loading speed, rendering, animations, images, bundle size |
| **Refine** | [`clarify`](./skills/impeccable/clarify) | Fix unclear UX copy, error messages, microcopy, labels, instructions |
| **Refine** | [`delight`](./skills/impeccable/delight) | Add joy, personality, unexpected touches — elevate functional to memorable |
| **Refine** | [`distill`](./skills/impeccable/distill) | Strip designs to their essence — declutter, simplify, focus |
| **Dial** | [`bolder`](./skills/impeccable/bolder) | Amplify safe or boring designs — more visual impact, character |
| **Dial** | [`quieter`](./skills/impeccable/quieter) | Tone down visually aggressive or overstimulating designs |
| **Dial** | [`overdrive`](./skills/impeccable/overdrive) | Push past conventional limits — shaders, spring physics, scroll-driven reveals, 60fps |
| **Review** | [`critique`](./skills/impeccable/critique) | UX evaluation with quantitative scoring, persona-based testing, anti-pattern detection |
| **Review** | [`audit`](./skills/impeccable/audit) | Technical quality checks — a11y, performance, theming, responsive, anti-patterns (P0–P3 severities) |
| **Ship** | [`polish`](./skills/impeccable/polish) | Final quality pass — alignment, spacing, consistency, micro-detail issues |

## 🎨 Taste (7 skills)

Opinionated **aesthetic-defining** skills. The "this is what high-end looks like" layer.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [`design-taste-frontend`](./skills/taste/design-taste-frontend) | Senior UI/UX engineer — overrides default LLM biases with metric-based rules, strict component architecture, hardware-accelerated CSS |
| [`high-end-visual-design`](./skills/taste/high-end-visual-design) | Design like a high-end agency — exact fonts, spacing, shadows, card structures, animations. Blocks the defaults that make AI designs look cheap |
| [`minimalist-ui`](./skills/taste/minimalist-ui) | Clean editorial-style interfaces — warm monochrome palette, typographic contrast, flat bento grids, muted pastels. No gradients, no heavy shadows |
| [`industrial-brutalist-ui`](./skills/taste/industrial-brutalist-ui) | Raw mechanical interfaces — Swiss typographic print meets military terminal aesthetics. Rigid grids, extreme type scale contrast, analog degradation effects |
| [`stitch-design-taste`](./skills/taste/stitch-design-taste) | Semantic design system for Google Stitch — generates DESIGN.md files enforcing premium, anti-generic UI standards |
| [`redesign-existing-projects`](./skills/taste/redesign-existing-projects) | Upgrade existing websites/apps to premium quality. Audits current design, identifies generic AI patterns, applies high-end standards |
| [`full-output-enforcement`](./skills/taste/full-output-enforcement) | Overrides default LLM truncation. Enforces complete code generation, bans placeholder patterns |

> ⚠️ **The 4 visual aesthetic skills are mutually exclusive.** A page is either `minimalist-ui` OR `industrial-brutalist-ui` OR `high-end-visual-design` OR `design-taste-frontend` — pick one per brand, don't combine.

## 🎯 Recommended Workflows

### Building a portco landing page (most common path)

```
shape → ui-ux-pro-max → impeccable → layout → typeset → colorize → polish → critique → ship
```

### Auditing an existing AI-generated UI

```
hallmark (audit) → critique → identify generic patterns → redesign-existing-projects → polish
```

### Portco brand identity from scratch

```
ckm-brand → brand-narrative-playbook → ckm-design-system → ckm-banner-design → efecto-graphic-design
```

### Investor pitch deck

```
efecto-graphic-design → ckm-slides → critique
```

### Quick conceptual sketch for early discovery

```
sketch-prompt → critique
```

### Making something "look expensive"

```
high-end-visual-design → typeset → polish → critique
```

## ⚠️ Honest concerns (worth design-team review)

These are **open questions** about the current state of the marketplace. Looking for design-team feedback:

1. **`ckm-*` and `efecto-*` overlap** on brand + slides + UI. Should we pick favorites per workflow, or are they meaningfully different?

2. **The 7 Taste skills feel under-defined.** Are aesthetic categories like "industrial brutalist" actually coherent and worth surfacing, or just one founder's preference?

3. **Three review skills** — `hallmark`, `critique`, `audit` — all evaluate designs. Three flavors of the same thing, or do they each pull distinct weight?

4. **No vendor-neutral design system token generator.** Only `ckm-design-system` covers this. Worth adding a more agnostic one?

5. **Possible missing categories:**
   - Color theory deep-dive (we have `colorize` but no foundational color skill)
   - Iconography
   - Logo systems (beyond `ckm-design`'s 55-style generator)
   - Illustration
   - Motion design beyond `animate` and `overdrive`
   - Print / packaging
   - 3D / WebGL design

6. **Impeccable suite dominance.** 17 of 42 skills come from one source. Healthy concentration or single-author bias?

If you have a strong opinion on any of these, please open an issue or PR.

## How to contribute or propose changes

### Adding a new design skill

1. Find an existing skill (open source GitHub repos like [nutlope/hallmark](https://github.com/nutlope/hallmark), [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable), [emilkowalski/skill](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skill), [Leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill)) or design your own
2. Install locally: `npx skills add <author/repo>`
3. Copy into the appropriate `skills/<category>/` folder
4. Add to the relevant pack(s) in [`packs.config.json`](./packs.config.json)
5. Run `./build-packs.sh`
6. Commit and push

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full flow.

### Killing or merging a skill

If you find an overlap or redundancy, open an issue or just open a PR removing/merging the skill. Less is more — we don't want noise.

### Suggesting an aesthetic / brand direction

If The Studio settles on one official aesthetic per portco type (e.g., "all FinTech portcos use `minimalist-ui`, all DeepTech use `industrial-brutalist-ui`"), document that here and we'll bake it into our recommendation flows.
