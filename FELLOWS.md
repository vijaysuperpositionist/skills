# 🎓 Welcome to Utopia Skills — Fellow Edition

A shared library of AI workflows built specifically for Studio fellows. Install one pack, and your AI (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.) instantly knows how Utopia does things — no more re-explaining context every time you open a chat.

> **Marketplace:** [`The-Utopia-Studio/skills`](https://github.com/The-Utopia-Studio/skills)
> **Maintainer:** Karan Pinto · karanmjpinto@gmail.com · `#utopia-skills` on Slack

## What this is, in one sentence

It's an "app store" of pre-built workflows for your AI. Four modules — GTM, Product, Investments, Founder Productivity — so you only load what's relevant.

## Why it matters

Today, when you ask AI to help with discovery work, you have to explain Utopia's approach every single time:
> "I'm a fellow at Utopia Capital. We use the JTBD framework. We don't do generic personas, we use proto-personas. We look at problem-market fit before solution design..."

With the right pack installed, your AI already knows. You just say:
> "I did 5 customer interviews. Synthesize the themes."

And get an output that already follows our methodology.

## Quick Start (~2 minutes)

**Easiest path:** open Claude Code and paste this:

```
Install the Utopia Skills marketplace for me.

1. Register the marketplace:
   /plugin marketplace add The-Utopia-Studio/skills

2. Install all four modules:
   /plugin install utopia-gtm@skills
   /plugin install utopia-product@skills
   /plugin install utopia-investments@skills
   /plugin install utopia-founder-productivity@skills

3. Confirm what's installed and tell me how to update later with:
   /plugin marketplace update skills

If any step fails, explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
Don't invent pack names — use only the four above.
```

Full instructions (Claude Code, Cursor, troubleshooting): **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)**

### Manual steps (if you prefer)

1. Install Claude Code: `curl -fsSL https://claude.com/install.sh | sh` then run `claude`
2. Register: `/plugin marketplace add The-Utopia-Studio/skills`
3. Install what you need:

```
/plugin install utopia-product@skills                # Discovery, design, build, deploy
/plugin install utopia-gtm@skills                    # Sales, marketing, growth
/plugin install utopia-investments@skills            # Fundraising, DD, modeling
/plugin install utopia-founder-productivity@skills   # Onboarding, legal, agents
```

Skills auto-trigger based on what you ask. If Claude picks the wrong one, just say which to use.

> **Don't want Claude Code?** Cursor and others work too — see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## 🎯 Quant pricing

Bayesian reasoning, forecasting, and auction-theory skills for pricing physical/emerging risks now live in **`utopia-investments`** — no separate pack.

```
/plugin install utopia-investments@skills
```

---

## How to Actually Use It

A few examples of what real fellow workflows look like with these skills installed:

### "I just finished customer interviews."
Just say:
> "I did 5 interviews about [topic]. Here are my notes. Synthesize the themes and map them to JTBD."

The AI uses `summarize-interview` + `jobs-to-be-done` automatically.

### "I need to brief my Studio coach on what I'm working on."
Just say:
> "Build me a one-page PRD for [product idea]. Include the problem, JTBD, ICP, and three risky assumptions to test."

The AI uses `one-pager-prd` + `identify-assumptions-new` + `ideal-customer-profile`.

### "I need to design a quick prototype."
Just say:
> "Sketch a landing page for [idea]. Use Utopia's design taste."

The AI uses `sketch-prompt` + `efecto-web-design` + `high-end-visual-design`.

### "I need to write a pitch deck for an investor meeting."
Just say:
> "Build me a 12-slide pitch deck from these notes [paste notes]. Investor-ready."

The AI uses `pitch-deck` (Utopia-branded automatically).

### "I need to find risks in my plan before I commit."
Just say:
> "Run a pre-mortem on [my plan]. What could go wrong?"

The AI uses `pre-mortem` + `forecast-premortem`.

## Updating

The marketplace gets new skills regularly. To pull updates:

```
/plugin marketplace update skills
```

Then reinstall whichever pack you want refreshed.

---

## FAQ

**Q: I don't write code. Will this be useful for me?**
Yes. Most skills are about strategy, discovery, fundraising, design, and ops — not just engineering. Use the AI like ChatGPT in a chat window.

**Q: I use Claude.ai web chat, not Claude Code. Can I still use this?**
Partially. Claude.ai web doesn't support the `/plugin` command. To use the marketplace properly, install Claude Code (it's free). Or DM Karan and he'll send you `.skill` files you can upload directly to Claude.ai under Settings → Capabilities → Skills.

**Q: Can I use this with Cursor or Codex?**
Yes. They support the same skill format. Run `npx skills add The-Utopia-Studio/skills` and follow the prompts.

**Q: Will this slow my AI down?**
No — only the skills in installed packs load. That's why we install one module at a time. More isn't better.

**Q: I have an idea for a skill that doesn't exist. How do I add it?**
Drop the idea in `#utopia-skills` Slack or DM Karan. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full flow.

**Q: A skill gave me a wrong/bad output. What do I do?**
DM Karan. We improve skills as we find edge cases — that's how they get better.

**Q: Can I uninstall a pack?**
Yes — `/plugin uninstall <pack-name>@skills`.

---

## TL;DR — three commands

```
1. Install Claude Code:               curl -fsSL https://claude.com/install.sh | sh
2. Register the marketplace:          /plugin marketplace add The-Utopia-Studio/skills
3. Install your current module pack:  /plugin install utopia-<module>@skills   # gtm | product | investments | founder-productivity
                                      where <module> is: onboarding, discovery, concept, legal,
                                      brand, product, gtm, fundraising, or ops
```

That's it. Welcome to the Studio.
