# EPC/PCT Legal Search Skill

Hybrid RAG search across the European Patent Convention (EPC), EPO Guidelines for Examination, and PCT Rules for patent law research.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when users ask to:
- Find EPC articles or rules on a specific topic
- Search EPO Guidelines for Examination
- Look up PCT rules or Administrative Instructions
- Compare EPC requirements with USPTO/MPEP practice
- Research EPO Board of Appeal case law principles
- Understand European patent prosecution procedure
- Find legal basis for EPO examination objections

## What This Skill Does

Provides legal research across European and international patent law:

1. **EPC Search** (European Patent Convention):
   - Articles 1-178 EPC
   - Rules 1-167 EPC (Implementing Regulations)
   - Protocol on Interpretation of Art. 69 EPC
   - Protocol on Centralisation
   - Protocol on Privileges and Immunities

2. **EPO Guidelines Search** (Guidelines for Examination):
   - Part A: Guidelines for Formalities Examination
   - Part B: Guidelines for Search
   - Part C: Guidelines for Procedural Aspects of Substantive Examination
   - Part D: Guidelines for Opposition and Limitation/Revocation
   - Part E: Guidelines for General Procedural Matters
   - Part F: Guidelines for Substantive Examination (The Patent Application)
   - Part G: Guidelines for Patentability
   - Part H: Guidelines for Amendments and Corrections

3. **PCT Rules Search** (Patent Cooperation Treaty):
   - PCT Articles 1-69
   - PCT Rules 1-96 (Regulations under the PCT)
   - Administrative Instructions under the PCT
   - WIPO Standards (ST.25, ST.26, ST.36)

4. **Cross-Jurisdiction Comparison**:
   - EPC vs 35 USC mapping
   - EPO Guidelines vs MPEP equivalents
   - PCT requirements vs national requirements

## Required Data

**MCP Tools Available**:
- `search_patent_law` - Search EPC, EPO Guidelines, PCT rules with jurisdiction parameter
- `search_mpep` - Search MPEP/35 USC/37 CFR for comparison

## How to Use

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Determine jurisdiction**:
   - EPO: search EPC articles/rules and EPO Guidelines
   - PCT: search PCT articles/rules and Administrative Instructions
   - Both: search across all sources
   - Comparison: search EPO + USPTO sources

2. **Execute search**:

   **EPC/EPO Guidelines search**:
   ```python
   results = search_patent_law(
       query="claim clarity requirements",
       jurisdiction="EPO",
       top_k=5
   )
   ```

   **PCT rules search**:
   ```python
   results = search_patent_law(
       query="unity of invention",
       jurisdiction="PCT",
       top_k=5
   )
   ```

   **Cross-jurisdiction comparison**:
   ```python
   epo_results = search_patent_law(query="sufficiency of disclosure", jurisdiction="EPO")
   us_results = search_mpep(query="enablement requirement")
   ```

3. **Present results**:
   - Show relevant provisions with full text
   - Provide article/rule numbers and section references
   - Include EPO Guidelines commentary
   - Note practical implications for prosecution

EPC/EPO LEGAL RESEARCH RESULTS
=================================

Query: "claim clarity requirements"
Jurisdiction: EPO (EPC + Guidelines)

[1] Art. 84 EPC - The Claims
    "The claims shall define the matter for which protection
    is sought. They shall be clear, concise and be supported
    by the description."

    EPO Guidelines F-IV, 4 - Clarity
    "Each claim should be read giving the words the meaning
    and scope which they normally have in the relevant art..."

    Key Points:
    - Claims must be clear on their own (not by reference to spec)
    - Technical terms given their normal meaning in the art
    - Relative terms need objective reference point
    - Functional features must be verifiable

[2] Rule 43(1) EPC - Form and content of claims
    "...shall contain: (a) a statement indicating the designation
    of the subject-matter and those technical features necessary
    for the definition... (preamble); and (b) a characterising
    portion preceded by 'characterised in that'..."

    EPO Guidelines F-IV, 3.2 - Two-part form
    "Independent claims should normally be in the two-part form..."

Related MPEP Comparison:
- MPEP 2173: Claims Must Particularly Point Out and Distinctly Claim
- 35 USC 112(b): Equivalent US clarity requirement
- Key difference: EPO applies stricter objective clarity standard
