## PCT Application Structure

### Request (Rule 4 PCT)

Form PCT/RO/101 requires:
- Applicant details (name, address, nationality, residence)
- Title of invention
- Priority claim(s) (if any, within 12 months)
- Designation of states (automatic for all since 2004)
- Choice of International Searching Authority (ISA)
- Agent/representative details

### Description (Rule 5 PCT)

Required sections in order:
```
1. Title of the Invention
2. Technical Field
3. Background Art
4. Disclosure of the Invention
   - Technical problem
   - Technical solution
   - Advantageous effects
5. Brief Description of Drawings
6. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention
7. Industrial Applicability
8. Sequence Listing (if applicable)
```

### Claims (Rule 6 PCT)

Structure requirements:
- Numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals
- Independent claims: define essential features of the invention
- Dependent claims: refer back and further limit
- Clear, concise, fully supported by description
- Multiple claim categories allowed (product, process, apparatus, use)
- Unity of invention required (Rule 13)

### Abstract (Rule 8 PCT)

- Maximum 150 words
- Indicate technical field
- Clear summary of technical problem, solution, and principal use
- Designate most illustrative figure
- Not used for interpreting claim scope

### Drawings (Rule 11 PCT)

- A4 paper (29.7cm x 21cm)
- Usable area: 26.2cm x 17cm
- Margins: top 2.5cm, left 2.5cm, right 1.5cm, bottom 1cm
- Black, dense, well-defined lines
- No text except single words
- Reference signs matching description

## Unity of Invention (Rule 13 PCT)

### Assessment Framework

Unity requires claims to relate to **one invention only** or a **group of inventions linked to form a single general inventive concept**.

**Test**: Do all claims share a **special technical feature** that:
1. Makes a contribution over the prior art, AND
2. Is present in all independent claims (or links them)

### Common Unity Patterns

**Unity Maintained**:
- Product + process for making product
- Product + use of product
- Process + apparatus specifically designed for process
- Product + process + apparatus (all sharing special technical feature)

**Unity at Risk**:
- Multiple independent claims without shared special technical feature
- Markush groups without common structural feature
- Method and apparatus addressing different problems

### Unity Strategy

```
Independent Claim 1 (System): A system comprising feature X...
Independent Claim 8 (Method): A method using feature X...
Independent Claim 15 (Use): Use of feature X for...

Special Technical Feature: "feature X" - shared across all groups
Unity: MAINTAINED (single general inventive concept linked by X)
```

## PCT Timeline

```
Month 0:  File PCT application at Receiving Office (RO)
Month 3:  International search begins (ISA)
Month 16: International Search Report (ISR) issued
Month 18: International publication (WIPO)
Month 22: Demand for preliminary examination (optional, Chapter II)
Month 28: International Preliminary Examination Report (IPER)
Month 30: National/regional phase entry deadline (most countries)
Month 31: National phase deadline (some countries: US, JP, etc.)
```

## Fee Calculation

### Base Fees (2025 estimates)

| Fee | Amount | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Transmittal fee | Varies by RO | RO/US: USD 280 |
| International filing fee | CHF 1,330 | Electronic reduction: -CHF 200 |
| Search fee | Varies by ISA | ISA/EP: EUR 1,775; ISA/US: USD 2,680 |
| Additional page fee | CHF 16/page | Beyond 30 pages |
| Additional claim fee | Varies | Beyond limits set by ISA |

### Electronic Filing Reduction

Filing via ePCT: CHF 200 reduction on international filing fee

### National Phase Fees (Estimates)

| Country | Entry Fee | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| US (371) | ~USD 1,600 | Basic filing + search + examination |
| EP (Euro-PCT) | ~EUR 2,595 | Filing + search + designation |
| JP | ~JPY 195,000 | National fee + translation |
| CN | ~CNY 3,500 | National fee + translation |
| KR | ~KRW 460,000 | National fee + translation |

## National Phase Strategy

### Key Decisions

1. **Which countries?** - Based on markets, competitors, manufacturing
2. **Which ISA?** - Affects search quality, cost, language
3. **Chapter II?** - Optional preliminary examination for stronger report
4. **Early national phase?** - Some countries allow before 30 months
5. **Translation strategy** - Cost and timing considerations

### Common Filing Strategies

**Broad Coverage**:
- US + EP + CN + JP + KR (covers ~85% of global patent value)

**Cost-Conscious**:
- US + EP only (defer others until commercial validation)

**Technology-Specific**:
- Pharma: US + EP + JP + CN + IN + BR
- Software: US + EP + JP + KR
- Manufacturing: US + EP + CN + DE + JP
