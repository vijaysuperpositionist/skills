# Diagnosing Forecast Misses

On-demand reference for the revops-forecasting skill.

The accuracy formula and benchmarks remain in the body. This file holds the diagnosis patterns for over-forecasting, under-forecasting, and high variance.

**Consistent over-forecasting (closing less than predicted):**
- Commit criteria too loose — reps putting Best Case deals in Commit
- Optimistic close dates — deals slipping to next period
- Insufficient qualification — deals in pipeline that shouldn't be
- Fix: Tighten Commit validation, implement deal review rigor

**Consistent under-forecasting (closing more than predicted):**
- Conservative culture — reps sandbagging to protect upside
- Expansion/upsell revenue not captured in pipeline
- Late-quarter inbound deals closing fast
- Fix: Incentivize accurate forecasting (not just attainment), capture all revenue sources

**High variance (sometimes over, sometimes under):**
- Insufficient deal volume for statistical prediction
- Lumpy deal sizes (one large deal swings everything)
- Inconsistent stage definitions — deals at "Proposal" mean different things to different reps
- Fix: Standardize stage definitions, increase pipeline volume, segment the forecast by deal size
