# Skills

A curated collection of AI coding skills for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any tool that supports the [Agent Skills Standard](https://github.com/runkids/skillshare). Also serves as a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** with curated packs for Utopia Capital teams and fellows.

> 📘 **Team / fellow / funds member?** Start with the [**Team Guide**](./GUIDE.md) — a step-by-step, non-technical intro to installing and using this marketplace. Share the link freely.

## Install as a Plugin Marketplace (Recommended for Teams)

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Team members register it once, then install only the packs they need.

**1. Register the marketplace (one-time):**

```
/plugin marketplace add The-Utopia-Studio/skills
```

**2. Install a pack:**

Two tracks: **Studio Cobuild packs** for fellows (mapped to M1–M9 modules) and **Funds packs** for internal Utopia Capital work.

```

## Available Packs

Each pack bundles a set of skills for a specific workflow. Install only what you need — keeps your context lean.

### Studio Cobuild packs (for fellows, mapped to M1–M9 modules)

Each pack maps 1:1 to a module in the Studio's Cobuild curriculum. Fellows install the pack for the module they're working on — keeps context lean and focused on the current stage.

| Module | Pack | # | What it covers |
|--------|------|---|----------------|
| **M1** | `utopia-studio-cobuild-onboarding` | 12 | Fellow Onboarding — market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), stakeholder mapping, PESTEL/Porter/SWOT, prioritization frameworks |

| **M3** | `utopia-studio-cobuild-concept` | 21 | Concept & Solution Design — PRDs, user stories, recommendation canvases, business models, prototyping, architecture diagrams |
| **M4** | `utopia-studio-cobuild-legal` | 5 | Legal & Entity Setup — NDA, privacy policy, hiring docs, press release. *Gap: MENA/GCC jurisdiction* |

| **M9** | `utopia-studio-cobuild-ops` | 27 | Operations & Finance — North Star metrics, unit economics, retention, churn, onboarding CRO, pricing, roadmap |

### Funds packs (for Utopia Capital's internal team)

Not for fellows — these are for the investment team doing DD, modeling, and research.

| Pack | # | What it covers |
|------|---|----------------|
| **utopia-funds-dd** | 6 | Technical Due Diligence — tech audits, security review, TDD reports, infra review |
| **utopia-funds-finance** | 16 | Financial Modeling & IB Toolkit — DCF, LBO, comps, tear sheets, deck work |
| **utopia-funds-markets** | 10 | Capital Markets — bonds, FX, options, macro rates, equity research (for fellows going sell-side) |
| **utopia-funds-research** | 6 | Research & Knowledge Management — Obsidian, markdown, web extraction, papers |

### Engagement-specific & specialty packs

Built for active portfolio engagements or specialty workflows. Install on top of the cobuild/funds packs as needed.

| Pack | # | What it covers |
|------|---|----------------|
| **utopia-quant-pricing** | 21 | **Quantitative pricing & physical risk modeling** — Bayesian reasoning, expected value, forecasting, adverse selection, auction theory, causal inference. For any work where you're pricing uncertainty under information asymmetry (data centre risk, climate, parametric insurance, emerging risks). |
| **utopia-internal-agents** | 5 | **Named Utopia AI agents with distinct personalities and persistent memory** — `Ada` (DD analyst, "what does the code actually do?"), `Khalil` (pitch deck builder, "what's the one thing they should remember?"), `Salim` (Studio fellow coach, Socratic, never gives the answer). Plus `agent-persona-builder` for designing new agents and `agent-prd` for producing the Agent PRD planning document before any agent code is written. See [agents/README.md](./agents/README.md). |

### Skill sources

Skills across the cobuild packs come from the best public repos for each layer:
- **Discovery (M2):** [phuryn/pm-skills](https://github.com/phuryn/pm-skills), [deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)
- **Concept (M3):** [phuryn/pm-skills](https://github.com/phuryn/pm-skills), [deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)
- **Brand (M5):** [pablostanley/efecto-plugin](https://github.com/pablostanley/efecto-plugin), [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable), [emilkowalski/skill](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skill), [Leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill)
- **Product (M6):** [osmanio2/vibe-to-prod](https://github.com/osmanio2/vibe-to-prod), [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills), Railway skills, [pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable)
- **GTM (M7):** [coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills), [chadboyda/agent-gtm-skills](https://github.com/chadboyda/agent-gtm-skills), [gtmagents/gtm-agents](https://github.com/gtmagents/gtm-agents)
- **Fundraising (M8) & Funds Finance:** [anthropics/financial-services-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/financial-services-plugins), plus proprietary Utopia `pitch-deck` and `technical-dd`
- **Ops (M9):** [phuryn/pm-skills](https://github.com/phuryn/pm-skills), [lyndonkl/claude](https://github.com/lyndonkl/claude), [Digidai/product-manager-skills](https://github.com/Digidai/product-manager-skills), [gtmagents/gtm-agents](https://github.com/gtmagents/gtm-agents)
- **Quant pricing:** [lyndonkl/claude](https://github.com/lyndonkl/claude) (Bayesian, forecasting, auction-theory skills curated into a dedicated pack)

### Honest gap map

The public ecosystem is richest for GTM and product discovery, decent for financial modeling, and weakest for:

1. **Agentic customer ops & NPS tracking** (M9 gap) — no strong dedicated skill repo exists
2. **GCC/MENA-aware legal, compliance, and cap table** (M4 gap) — nothing jurisdiction-specific

Both are candidates to build as proprietary Studio skills — high-value, jurisdiction-specific, unlikely to appear in the open ecosystem.

See [`packs.config.json`](./packs.config.json) for the exact skill list in each pack.

### Adding or Editing Packs

Packs are defined in [`packs.config.json`](./packs.config.json). To add a new pack or move skills between packs:

1. Edit `packs.config.json` — add a pack entry or update the `skills` array
2. Run `./build-packs.sh` — regenerates `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `plugins/`
3. Commit and push — team members get the update via `/plugin marketplace update skills`

Example: add a new `utopia-research-pack`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "utopia-research-pack",
  "description": "Research and analysis skills for fellows",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "keywords": ["research", "analysis"],
  "skills": ["defuddle", "huggingface-papers"]
}
```

Then `./build-packs.sh && git add -A && git commit -m "Add research pack" && git push`.

Requires `jq` (`brew install jq`).

## For Contributors & Fellows

Want to propose a new skill, or understand the curation process? See:

- **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** — sandbox → pack graduation flow, curation principles, how to write good skills
- **[`DESIGN_GUIDE.md`](./DESIGN_GUIDE.md)** — full index of all 42 design skills (foundations, Impeccable, Taste, Efecto, brand). Workflows, sources, open questions for design-team review.
- **[`SKILL_TAXONOMY.md`](./SKILL_TAXONOMY.md)** — all 82 skills mapped to the 9-category taxonomy from Anthropic's Skills guide. Shows gaps (verification, data retrieval, runbooks) and overlaps.
- **[`skills/sandbox/`](./skills/sandbox/)** — staging area for experimental skills before they graduate
- **[`hooks/README.md`](./hooks/README.md)** — optional skill-usage logging hook, so you can see which skills are actually used

## Skill Composition

Some skills call other skills. For example, `impeccable` orchestrates the full design pipeline by invoking `shape` (plan) → `layout` → `typeset` → `colorize` → `animate` → `critique` → `audit` → `polish`.

This matters when choosing packs:
- Installing a single skill that depends on others may silently degrade if the dependencies aren't installed
- `utopia-design-pack` bundles all 17 Impeccable skills together so composition works end-to-end
- If you cherry-pick, check the skill's SKILL.md for "related skills" references

There's no explicit dependency system yet — Claude invokes related skills by name, which only works if they're installed.

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file (and optionally assets/references). When your AI tool loads a skill, it gains that capability — like giving it a new manual for a specific workflow.
